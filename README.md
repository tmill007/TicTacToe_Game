# Tic Tac Toe - Java CLI Project

This is a simple **Command Line Interface (CLI)** implementation of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game using **Java**. The game allows two players to take turns marking cells on a 3x3 board until a win condition is met or the game ends in a draw.

## üí° Features

- Two-player mode (no AI)
- Clear input prompts and board visualization
- Win and draw detection
- Replay prompt after game conclusion
- Input validation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Java (Core)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- IntelliJ IDEA (IDE)
- Also utilizes Design Patterns

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory and open it in IntelliJ or your preferred Java IDE.

3. Compile and run the `TicTacToeGame.java` file.

## üìå Future Improvements

- Add a single-player mode with basic AI
 Future Enhancements
- Add a Graphical User Interface (GUI): Upgrade from CLI to a desktop GUI using JavaFX or Swing for a more intuitive user experience.

- Web Integration with Spring Boot: Transform the app into a web-based game using Spring Boot with RESTful APIs.

- Database Connectivity: Integrate a database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) to store game history, player scores, and user profiles.

- Multiplayer Functionality: Allow two remote players to connect and play online via socket programming or HTTP requests.

- AI Opponent: Implement a basic AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm or simple heuristics.

- Mobile App Version: Rebuild the project as a mobile game using Flutter or Android Studio.

- Unit Testing with JUnit: Add automated tests for key game functions and user interactions.

- Leaderboard System: Create a leaderboard that dynamically ranks players based on game performance.
